# Ruby Experiments: A repository of experiments conducted while learning Ruby

This is a collection of tiny Ruby scripts created during my ongoing process of learning Ruby.

________

Caesar Cipher:  A script which accepts a string and a shift factor, shifting each letter of 
the string forward in the alphabet the specified number of times.  Spaces and non-alphabetic characters are exempt.


Stock Picker:  A small script which, when given an array of numbers representing stock prices, selects the 
buy and sell days which would have resulted in the greatest profit.


Substrings: Given a string and an array of words, this script will find all instances of the dictionary substrings
in the string of text, returning a hash of each substring along with it's frequency.  Words are matched using variable 
facilitated regex.
